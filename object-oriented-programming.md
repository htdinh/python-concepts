    <summary>What are classes and instances in OOP?</summary>
    ### Class
    A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, defining a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the created objects will have. 

    ### Instance
    While the class is the blueprint, an instance is an object that is built from a class and contains real data. An instance of the Dog class is not a blueprint anymore. It’s an actual dog with a name, like Miles, who’s four years old.
